Please fix the delete behavior on the Archivio page and adjust the UI as described below.

Fix delete logic in Archivio modal

Go to the component that renders the Archivio page (route /archivio, e.g. src/pages/Archive.tsx or similar) and the component that manages the edit article modal.

Currently:

The trash icon on each article card does nothing.

The Elimina button inside the edit modal also doesn’t actually delete the article.

Fix the delete flow so that when the user opens an article, taps the Elimina button in the modal, and confirms:

The article is deleted from the articoli table in Supabase.

All related rows in missing_items with articolo_id equal to the deleted article’s id are also deleted.

The article disappears from the Archivio list without needing a manual refresh.

If the deleted article was present in the Home “missing items” list, those entries also disappear because missing_items has been cleaned up.

If there is already a confirmation step in the modal, reuse it; if not, show a simple confirmation dialog before deleting.

Remove trash icon from article cards and reposition the “+” button

In the Archivio article list UI, remove the trash icon from each article card entirely (no more delete button on the card).

Keep the existing “+” button (which adds the article to the missing items list) but move it to the position previously occupied by the trash icon on the right side of the card.

The plus button should now be the only action icon visible on the card.

Maintain touch-friendly sizing and spacing; do not break the current scrolling behavior or layout.

Keep all other behaviors unchanged

Do not change how the plus button works logically: it must still add the article to missing_items only if it is not already present.

Do not change the way articles are loaded, sorted, or searched in Archivio.

Do not modify other pages (Home, Settings, Analysis, Backup, Import) or their scroll logic.

Final check and summary

After your changes, verify:

Clicking on an article card opens the modal.

The modal allows editing the name and deleting the article via the Elimina button, and deletion works end-to-end with Supabase updates and UI refresh.

The article cards show only the “+” icon on the right side, and it still correctly adds to the missing items list.
