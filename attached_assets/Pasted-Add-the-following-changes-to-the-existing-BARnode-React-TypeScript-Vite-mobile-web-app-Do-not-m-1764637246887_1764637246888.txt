Add the following changes to the existing BARnode React + TypeScript + Vite mobile web app.
Do not modify any business logic, Supabase schema, scroll behavior, or page-locking logic. Only adjust UI and the small interaction described below.

“+” quick-add button on Archivio cards

On the /archivio page, each article card currently shows a trash icon on the right.

Add a new “+” icon to each article card, positioned immediately to the left of the trash icon, with consistent size, color and spacing.

When the user taps the “+” icon:

Add that article to the missing_items table using the same logic already used to add an item to the missing list from the Home page.

This means creating a missing_items row with the correct articolo_id (and created_at or equivalent), and updating the UI to reflect that the item is now in the missing list.

Tapping the card itself must still open the edit modal as it does now.

Tapping the trash icon must still delete the article as it does now (use event.stopPropagation() or similar so the icons do not trigger card click).

The new “+” icon must not open any modal; it’s a direct quick-add to the missing items list.

Do not change list scrolling, layout containers, or page structure.

Title and spacing adjustments on Home and Archivio

On both the Home page (/) and the Archivio page (/archivio):

The page titles (“Lista articoli mancanti” and “Archivio articoli”) are currently too close to the search box.

Increase the vertical spacing between the title and the search box slightly so the layout breathes more.

The space between the search box and the first list item (the cards area) is currently too large.

Reduce this vertical spacing so the cards appear closer to the search box.

Constraints for this change:

Do not alter any scroll or page-locking logic (no changes to scroll containers, overflow rules, or fixed headers).

Only adjust margins/padding for the title and search box area and for the gap between the search box and the list.

Ensure the visual result is consistent on both Home and Archivio.

Documentation updates in docs/

After implementing the changes above, update all existing Markdown documentation files in the docs folder to reflect the new behavior:

01_STRUTTURA_BARNODE.md

02_STRUTTURA_SUPABASE_RENDER.md

03_FLUSSI_FUNZIONALI_E_REGOLE_BUSINESS_BARNODE_WEB.md

04_GOVERNANCE_CASCADE_E_MANUTENZIONE_BARNODE_WEB.md

05_CHECKLIST_QA_E_TEST_REGRESSIONE.md

06_LINEE_GUIDA_LAYOUT_UI_UX_BARNODE.md

07_STANDARD_CODICE_E_CONVENZIONI_TS_REACT.md

For each file, add a short, relevant note where appropriate, mentioning:

that on the Archivio page every article card now includes a “+” quick-add icon that adds the article directly to the missing items list on Home;

that the vertical spacing between titles, search boxes, and lists on Home/Archivio has been refined for better readability and mobile layout.

Keep the documentation style consistent with the existing tone of each file and do not add any platform-specific references.

General constraints

Do not change Supabase schemas or RPCs.

Do not modify existing business logic except where strictly needed to wire the new “+” button into the existing missing-items add flow.

Do not touch any scroll, overflow, or page-locking behavior.

Keep the mobile-first design and current color palette and typography; only introduce the new icon and spacing tweaks.

At the end, provide a concise summary of:

which code files were modified (components, hooks, styles),

which documentation files were updated,

and the main changes applied.
