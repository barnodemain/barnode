Update the existing BARnode React + TypeScript + Vite mobile web app with the following tasks.
Do not modify Supabase schemas or RPCs, and do not change any scroll/page-lock behavior. Only adjust UI and small pieces of logic where explicitly requested.

“+” quick-add button on Archivio cards (with duplicate protection)

On the /archivio page, each article card already has a trash icon on the right.

Add a “+” icon to each article card, positioned immediately to the left of the trash icon, matching the style (size, color, spacing) of the other icons.

When the user taps the “+” icon, add that article to the missing_items list using the same logic currently used on the Home page to add a missing item:

create a missing_items row with the correct articolo_id (and created_at if needed),

update the UI so the missing-items list is in sync.

Duplicate protection:

If an article is already present in the missing-items list, the “+” icon for that article must not be visible.

Use existing state/store or queries to know which articolo_id values are already in missing_items, and conditionally render the “+” icon only when the article is not missing.

Tapping the article card itself must still open the edit modal as before.

Tapping the trash icon must still delete the article as before (use event.stopPropagation() so icons do not trigger the card click).

The “+” icon must not open any modal; it is a direct quick-add.

Do not change list containers or scroll behavior.

Title and spacing adjustments on Home and Archivio

On both the Home page (/) and the Archivio page (/archivio):

Increase slightly the vertical space between the page title and the search box, so the title is not too close to the filter.

Reduce the vertical gap between the search box and the first list item (the first card), so the list appears closer to the search box.

Constraints:

Do not modify scroll/overflow logic or the structural layout (no changes to which elements are scrollable).

Only adjust margins/padding for titles, search box, and the gap above the list.

Codebase analysis and cleanup for stability and performance

Perform a careful analysis of the entire codebase and apply small, safe improvements. The goal is to increase stability and speed without changing app behavior.

Specifically:

Identify and remove:

dead/unused files (components, hooks, styles) that are never imported,

obviously obsolete or duplicate files that serve no purpose.

For files that are similar but both in use, do not merge them; just clean up truly unused code.

Check for:

unused imports,

variables or functions that are never used,

obvious console warnings or TypeScript warnings that can be safely fixed.

Where useful and low-risk, improve performance by:

avoiding unnecessary re-renders (e.g. memoizing simple components or callbacks where clearly beneficial),

ensuring list items have stable key props,

cleaning up any heavy computations inside render that can be moved out or memoized.

Do not introduce large refactors or change the overall architecture.

Ensure npm run build and npm run dev work cleanly without errors.

Documentation updates in docs/

After implementing the feature and cleanup, update the documentation files in the docs folder to reflect the current state of the app, especially the new quick-add button and the spacing tweaks:

01_STRUTTURA_BARNODE.md

02_STRUTTURA_SUPABASE_RENDER.md

03_FLUSSI_FUNZIONALI_E_REGOLE_BUSINESS_BARNODE_WEB.md

04_GOVERNANCE_CASCADE_E_MANUTENZIONE_BARNODE_WEB.md

05_CHECKLIST_QA_E_TEST_REGRESSIONE.md

06_LINEE_GUIDA_LAYOUT_UI_UX_BARNODE.md

07_STANDARD_CODICE_E_CONVENZIONI_TS_REACT.md

Add short, relevant notes where appropriate, describing:

that the Archivio page now has a “+” quick-add icon on each article card, which is shown only when the article is not already in the missing-items list, and adds the article directly to the Home missing-items list;

that the vertical spacing between titles, search boxes, and lists on Home/Archivio has been refined for better readability;

that a general cleanup pass was done on unused files and imports to improve stability and performance.

Do not mention any specific development platform in these docs.

Final summary

After completing all tasks, provide a concise summary that includes:

a list of code files that were added, removed, or modified, with a brief description of the changes,

a list of documentation files that were updated and what was added,

any notable stability or performance improvements you made.
