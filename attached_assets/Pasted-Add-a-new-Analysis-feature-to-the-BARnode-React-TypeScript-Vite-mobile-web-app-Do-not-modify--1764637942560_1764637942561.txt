Add a new “Analysis” feature to the BARnode React + TypeScript + Vite mobile web app.
Do not modify Supabase schemas, scroll behavior, page locking, or existing business logic unless explicitly requested.

1) Add an “ANALYSIS” button to the Settings page

On the /settings page:

Add a third button under IMPORTA and BACKUP.

Label: ANALYSIS

Style:

same layout, size, rounded shape and typography as the other two buttons,

background color: yellow-amber, with dark text/icon,

same mobile-friendly spacing and elevation/shadow.

When tapped, it should navigate to a new route:
/settings/analysis

2) Create the new page: Analysis

Create a new page component for route /settings/analysis with:

BARnode logo at the top (same as other pages),

centered title: Analysis,

same background, spacing, and mobile-first layout as the rest of the app.

This page must analyze all article names in the articoli table and detect groups of similar or duplicate articles, allowing the user to consolidate or clean them.

3) Similarity detection logic

Implement a lightweight, client-side grouping algorithm with these rules:

For each article name:

convert to lowercase,

normalize (remove accents),

split into words,

remove all stopwords (common words that must be ignored).

Stopwords include:

product categories or generic words like:
vodka, rum, gin, vino, birra, amaro, liquore, soda, acqua, cibo, articolo, drink, bottle

prepositions and filler words:
di, al, alla, con, the, a, da, per, and, or, la, le, il, lo, un, uno, una

You can also add other obvious common words if needed.

After filtering stopwords, the remaining words are the keywords for comparison.

Grouping logic:

Two or more articles belong to the same group if they share at least one relevant keyword.

Example:
“Vodka Grey Goose”, “Grey Goose 1L”, “Grey Goose Mini”
→ group under keyword “grey goose”.

Create an array of groups, each containing:

group keyword(s),

list of article objects that are considered similar.

Only show groups that contain 2 or more articles.

4) Analysis page UI

For each detected group:

Show a white rounded card (matching existing styling) containing:

a group header (main keyword or combined keywords),

a vertical list of all articles in the group.

In each article row inside the group:

Display the article name.

Add a radio button / selector to allow the user to choose a primary name (the “corrected” name to keep).

Add one action button (inside each row or group footer) to apply consolidation.

Consolidation behavior:

When the user chooses a “primary” name:

Option to rename all other articles in the group to the primary name.

Or optionally allow the user to skip and leave the group unchanged.

All interactions must be:

touch-friendly,

mobile-optimized,

using BARnode colors and typography,

consistent with Home and Archivio cards.

Do not change the fullscreen scroll behavior of the page.

5) Safety rules for consolidation

When the user confirms consolidation:

Update the affected articles in the articoli table with the selected primary name.

For each updated article, also update any corresponding rows in missing_items so their articolo_id and displayed name remain consistent.

Use the same logic used in the app when renaming an article from the edit modal.

6) Documentation updates

Update the following documentation files inside the /docs folder:

01_STRUTTURA_BARNODE.md

03_FLUSSI_FUNZIONALI_E_REGOLE_BUSINESS_BARNODE_WEB.md

04_GOVERNANCE_CASCADE_E_MANUTENZIONE_BARNODE_WEB.md

05_CHECKLIST_QA_E_TEST_REGRESSIONE.md

06_LINEE_GUIDA_LAYOUT_UI_UX_BARNODE.md

For each file, add a short section describing:

the new ANALYSIS button in Settings,

the existence and purpose of the Analysis page,

the algorithm that groups similar articles by keywords,

the ability to consolidate duplicate/similar article names.

7) Final summary

At the end, provide a concise summary listing:

which components/files were created or modified,

how the Analysis algorithm was implemented,

which documentation files were updated.
