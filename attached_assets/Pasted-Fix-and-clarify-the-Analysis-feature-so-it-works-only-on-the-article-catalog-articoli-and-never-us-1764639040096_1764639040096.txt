Fix and clarify the Analysis feature so it works only on the article catalog (articoli) and never uses the missing items list as a source for grouping. Also fix the behavior so that once a duplicate group is resolved, it is not shown again if there are no real duplicates left.

Current bug example:

I had a duplicate group for “pane frico”.

I selected one of the two options and clicked Consolida.

The consolidation was applied (now there is only one “pane frico” in Archivio), but the duplicate group is still shown on the Analysis page.

This means the Analysis logic is not correctly using fresh data, or it is looking at the wrong source.

Please do the following.

Verify data sources (must be only articoli)

Inspect the code for the Analysis page (e.g. src/pages/Analysis.tsx or similar):

Confirm that the grouping algorithm and the list of items used for Analysis come only from the articoli table (the catalog of articles).

Ensure that the missing_items table is never used as a source when building duplicate groups.

It is allowed to update missing_items after a consolidation (to keep names in sync), but missing_items must not create or influence Analysis groups.

If you find any place where missing_items is used to build or influence Analysis groups, remove that logic and rely strictly on articoli for Analysis.

Guarantee groups are based on fresh articoli data

After a successful consolidation:

Reload the current list of articles from articoli (via Supabase or the shared store that represents that table).

Recompute duplicate groups using this updated list.

Ensure that the grouping function never uses stale copies of data.

If there is now only one article “pane frico” in articoli, the Analysis page must not generate any group for it.

Strengthen the grouping rule

Update the grouping logic so that:

A group is created only when there are at least two distinct article IDs in that group.

A single article (even with multiple keywords) must never produce a group.

After consolidation, if the updated articoli data contains only one matching article, the corresponding group must disappear.

Add explicit guards if needed, for example:
